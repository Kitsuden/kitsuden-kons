/**
 * Streamers routes as kon SDK operations
 * ============================================================================
 *
 * The routes file used to register its handlers on a `Hono` with
 * `app.get(path, ...middlewares, handler)`. Now it registers OPERATIONS with the
 * same shape: `app.get(path, declaration, handler)`, where the declaration
 * (id, schemas, access, permission, errors) replaces the middlewares and the
 * handler stays the same as ever —it receives the Hono context `c`—.
 *
 * So the body of each route does not change when moving to the SDK (docs/kons/README.md):
 * what changes is what is DECLARED, which is where the validation, the
 * OpenAPI, the MCP tool and the fine-grained scope `kon:streamers:<id>` come from.
